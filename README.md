## Welcome to the TelegramChat GitHub repository!
TelegramChat is a Spigot plugin compatible with Spigot versions 1.7 through 1.16.*, that connects Telegram with Minecraft.

### Usage
1. Create a new bot by messaging the @BotFather and following the instructions.
2. Obtain the token (`/tokentype` in Telegram) and type  `/linktelegram <token>` to link the newly created Bot to your Server. This needs to be done once.
3. Each user needs to be linked to their Telegram account in order to chat mc <-> telegram.
 
## Private chats
1. Your users need to type `/telegram` in-game to get a temporary code for linking
2. The code is then sent to the Telegram bot.

## Group chats
1. As an admin, you need to set the privacy setting to disabled using the BotFather. This is done by typing `/setprivacy` and then disabled.
2. Users just need to join the group to see the MC chat. They might want to link their account by posting their /linktelegram code in the group chat.
